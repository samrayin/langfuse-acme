# Contributing to this fork (ACME conventions)

This file governs ACME-specific changes to this Langfuse fork. For contributing to
Langfuse itself, see the upstream `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## The one rule that matters

**Every ACME change is its own commit, and gets its own entry in
`ACME-CHANGELOG.md` in that same commit.** Never bundle an ACME customization into
an unrelated commit, and never let a change land without a changelog entry — that's
exactly how this fork started (one giant squashed commit with no record of what
changed or why), and it's what this convention exists to prevent going forward.

## Commit message shape

```
ACME: <short description>

<why this change exists — the reasoning, not just the what>
<any licensing/security consideration, if relevant>

See ACME-CHANGELOG.md for full detail.
```

Use `ACME branding:` / `ACME Enhancements:` / `ACME AI:` prefixes to match the
existing history when the change fits one of those areas; otherwise `ACME:` alone
is fine.

## Changelog entry shape

Each `ACME-CHANGELOG.md` entry should answer, in this order:
1. **What** changed (files touched).
2. **Why** this approach was chosen — especially if it's working around an
   Enterprise-licensed feature; cite the specific entitlement and where it's
   checked in source, don't assert from memory.
3. **Deployment status** — has this actually shipped to a running environment, or
   is it source-only?
4. Anything **known-incomplete** that needs attention before production.

## Before marking anything "done"

- If the change touches licensing-gated territory, verify against the actual
  source (`ee/` entitlement checks), not against docs or assumption — this fork's
  own history has already caught real docs/code mismatches more than once.
- If the change is meant to reach a live environment, it isn't done until it's
  actually in a built image and deployed — "committed" and "deployed" are
  different states, and `ACME-CHANGELOG.md` should say which one applies.

## Integrations (LiteLLM, NeMo Guardrails, promptfoo, …) live in `integrations/`

Anything that isn't Langfuse itself or a customization of it — a gateway, a
guardrails layer, an eval tool — gets its own folder under `integrations/<name>/`
at the repo root, never mixed into `web/`, `worker/`, or `packages/`:

```
integrations/
  litellm/
    README.md      # what it is, how it connects, current status
    config/         # the integration's own native config
    terraform/      # opt-in infra additions specific to this integration
```

Rules that keep this from turning into the same mess ACME-Rayin's own history
started as:
1. **Self-contained.** Its own README, its own config, its own deploy
   artifacts. Deleting the folder should not break Langfuse or any other
   integration.
2. **Never edits core Langfuse code.** If RayIn's UI needs to surface or link
   to it, that's one small addition under the existing
   `web/src/features/acme-enhancements/` pattern, pointing *out* to the
   integration — not the integration's own logic living inside that feature.
3. **Its infra is opt-in.** A toggle/module a customer's deployment can
   include or skip, not permanently added to the shared
   `infra/langfuse-terraform-azure` module. A customer who doesn't want
   LiteLLM shouldn't be forced to deploy it.
4. **Its own commit prefix** (`Integration(<name>): <description>`) and its
   own history in that integration's README — `ACME-CHANGELOG.md` stays
   scoped to Langfuse/RayIn customization specifically, not integrations.

## Git history

~~This repository's history starts from a snapshot of Langfuse v4.17.0...~~ —
**resolved.** `main` is now built on a real clone of upstream Langfuse's
history (tag `v4.33.0`), with every ACME commit cherry-picked on top
individually. A future upstream version bump can use a normal `git merge`/
rebase against the next upstream tag instead of manually replaying patches.
