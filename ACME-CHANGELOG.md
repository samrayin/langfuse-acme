# ACME Customization Changelog

This file catalogs every ACME-specific customization made to this Langfuse fork —
what changed, why, how it works, and its current status. It exists so this fork can
go to production with full context, not as a pile of undocumented patches.

**Convention going forward:** every ACME change lands as its own commit (never bundled
into an unrelated change), and gets an entry here in the same commit. See
`CONTRIBUTING-ACME.md` for the exact process.

**Versioning:** every change that reaches the live deployment gets an annotated git
tag at that commit, `acme-v4.33.0.N` (N incrementing: `.1`, `.2`, ...), pushed to
`origin`. The tag message lists the full current ACME feature set, so
`git clone` + `git checkout <tag>` reliably reconstructs exactly what was live at
that point — no need to replay commit history or guess which combination of patches
was actually deployed. See "Tagging convention" below for what a tag does and does
not capture.

**Base version:** Langfuse `v4.33.0` (upgraded from `v4.17.0` on 2026-09-10 — see
"Upgrade to v4.33.0" below), Helm chart `2.0.0` — matches what's live on
`langfuse-dev.aiatacme.com` (see `Azure Blueprint/ENVIRONMENT-STUDY.md` in the
companion infrastructure project for the full deployment audit).

**Status of this fork as a whole:** **live on `langfuse-dev.aiatacme.com`** as of
2026-09-10. Both container images (`acmelangfuseacr.azurecr.io/langfuse-web:acme-dev`,
`acmelangfuseacr.azurecr.io/langfuse-worker:acme-dev`) are built, pushed, and
deployed — `kubectl get pods -n langfuse` shows both `1/1 Running`, 0 restarts. See
the "Live deployment" entry near the end of this file for the full path to get
there (including two real bugs found and fixed along the way — an ACR build OOM
and a CRLF-corrupted entrypoint script). Terraform itself does **not** yet manage
this deployment — see that same entry for why and what's needed to close that gap.

## 2026-09-09 — ACME branding (logo)

**What:** Replaced Langfuse's stock logo assets with ACME's own.

**Files:**
- `web/public/icon.svg`
- `web/public/wordart-black.svg`
- `web/public/wordart-white.svg`

**Why this approach, not Langfuse's paid UI-customization feature:** Langfuse's own
logo-replacement mechanism (`self-host-ui-customization` entitlement) requires an
Enterprise license *and* is co-branding only — the customer's logo sits alongside
Langfuse's, never replacing it (verified directly in `LangfuseLogo.tsx` during the
branding audit). Editing these three MIT-licensed static files directly achieves a
cleaner, full replacement than the paid feature does, at zero licensing cost. See the
branding audit (`AWS blueprint/langfuse-logo-branding-audit.md` in the companion
project) for the full legal reasoning — MIT permits this; only files under `ee/` would
require a license, and none of these three are.

**Deployment status:** Was briefly live on `langfuse-dev.aiatacme.com` via a manually
`kubectl`-applied ConfigMap + volume mount **outside Helm's own management** — a fragile
setup that a future `helm upgrade` would silently revert, since the chart's own
`extraVolumes`/`extraVolumeMounts` values (the correct, Helm-native mechanism) were
never actually set to `[]` → populated. That manual patch is not durable and is not
what's being version-controlled here. This commit instead bakes the files directly into
the fork's source tree, so they become part of any image built from this repo
permanently — no ConfigMap, no volume mount, no drift risk.

---

## 2026-09-09 — Contact ACME Support button

**What:** Added a "Contact ACME Support" button to the in-app Support panel, ahead of
the community GitHub links.

**File:** `web/src/features/support-chat/IntroSection.tsx`

**Why this approach:** Same reasoning as the logo — Langfuse's own `supportHref`
customization field exists for exactly this, but it's gated behind the same
Enterprise `self-host-ui-customization` entitlement (verified in
`uiCustomizationRouter.ts` — the whole customization object returns `null`
server-side without a valid license, regardless of what env vars are set). This button
is added directly to the MIT-licensed component instead, at zero licensing cost.

**Current target:** `mailto:anees.r@almoayyedcomputers.com` — a placeholder pointing at
a personal inbox. **Before production, this needs to become a real ACME support
channel** (a shared inbox or ticketing system), not an individual's email address.

**Deployment status:** Not yet deployed anywhere — source-only, same as everything
below.

---

## 2026-09-09 — ACME Enhancements: Audit Logs page

**What:** A new "ACME Enhancements" sidebar section with a license-free Audit Logs
viewer.

**Files:**
- `web/src/features/acme-enhancements/server/acmeAuditLogsRouter.ts`
- `web/src/features/acme-enhancements/components/AcmeAuditLogsTable.tsx`
- `web/src/features/acme-enhancements/pages/AcmeAuditLogsPage.tsx`
- `web/src/pages/project/[projectId]/acme-enhancements/audit-logs.tsx`
- `web/src/components/layouts/routes.tsx` (new nav entry + `RouteGroup.AcmeEnhancements`)
- `web/src/server/api/root.ts` (registers `acmeAuditLogs` router)

**Why this approach:** Verified during the original deployment audit that audit-log
*writes* are completely ungated in Langfuse OSS (`auditLog.ts` has no plan/entitlement
check) — only the official viewer UI is Enterprise-gated (`audit-logs` entitlement,
`auditLogs.ts:89,189`). That viewer component lives under `web/src/ee/`, which the root
`LICENSE` carves out as Enterprise-licensed regardless of what the code does at
runtime — so it can't be reused directly. This is a from-scratch reimplementation of
the same read query (same Prisma model, same pagination shape) in an MIT-licensed
location, using ordinary project RBAC (`auditLogs:read`) instead of the entitlement
check. No write path exists in this router — read-only by construction.

**Deployment status:** Not yet deployed.

---

## 2026-09-09 — ACME AI: in-app chat

**What:** A chat assistant embedded natively in the console (floating widget, bottom
right of every project-scoped page), grounded in the project's own trace data plus
ACME's operational knowledge.

**Files:**
- `web/src/features/acme-enhancements/server/acmeChatRouter.ts`
- `web/src/features/acme-enhancements/server/acmeKnowledgeBase.ts`
- `web/src/features/acme-enhancements/components/AcmeChatWidget.tsx`
- `web/src/components/layouts/app-layout/variants/AuthenticatedLayout.tsx` (widget wired
  into the global layout, `panel` layer band)
- `web/src/env.mjs` (new `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` server-only env var)
- `web/package.json` (new `@anthropic-ai/sdk` dependency)
- `web/src/server/api/root.ts` (registers `acmeChat` router)

**Architecture, and why it's simpler than first assumed:** Originally scoped as
needing a separate backend service plus a Content-Security-Policy patch (to allow an
externally-loaded widget script). Neither turned out to be necessary once designed as
a *native* Next.js feature instead of an externally-embedded one:
- The chat backend runs server-side inside the already-authenticated tRPC process — no
  new service to deploy.
- CSP only restricts what the *browser* loads/calls; a same-origin tRPC mutation never
  triggers it. **No CSP change was needed at all.**
- Project data access reuses the same session-authenticated repository functions the
  rest of the app already uses (`getTracesTable`, `getTraceById`,
  `getObservationsForTrace`, `getScoresForTraces` from `@langfuse/shared/src/server`) —
  not a round-trip through Langfuse's own external MCP endpoint, which would have
  required solving a separate per-project API-key provisioning problem.

**Security design** (mirrors the standalone `acme_ai.py` reference tool built earlier
in this engagement — see that tool's own README for the fuller rationale):
1. **Read-only by construction** — the tool set (`list_recent_traces`,
   `get_trace_detail`) only ever calls read repository functions. No write tool is
   defined; Claude has no code path to mutate project data through this feature.
2. **Prompt-injection-safe tool results** — every tool result is wrapped in
   `<untrusted_data source="...">` tags before entering the conversation, with an
   explicit system-prompt instruction to treat that content as data, never as
   instructions, and to report (not comply with) anything inside those tags that looks
   like an injection attempt. Trace content originates from the project's own end
   users and must be treated as potentially adversarial.
3. **Project-scoped by the existing tRPC session** — a user can only ever query the
   project they're already authorized to view; no separate credential to provision or
   leak.

**Differentiator, not just parity:** Langfuse's own "Ask AI" (Cloud) is a docs
assistant with no access to a customer's actual data. This is grounded in the
project's real traces — something Langfuse's Enterprise tier doesn't offer at any
price. See `Azure Blueprint/ACME-Enterprise-Offering-Comparison.xlsx` (companion
project) for how this was priced into the offering.

**Known limitation:** the tool set is intentionally small (2 tools) for this first
version. Extending it to cover more of the read surface (scores, datasets, prompts)
follows the same pattern — add a function, add it to `TOOLS`, wire it in `runTool`.

**Deployment status:** Not yet deployed. Also not yet tested against a live Claude API
call end-to-end (the standalone reference tool hit an Anthropic account credit-balance
error during its own test; this in-app version has not been separately smoke-tested).

## 2026-09-09/10 — Build fix: strip `--platform` from Dockerfile FROM lines for ACR builds

**What:** Removed the `--platform=...` flag entirely from every `FROM` line in both
`web/Dockerfile` and `worker/Dockerfile` (7 stages each).

**Files:**
- `web/Dockerfile`
- `worker/Dockerfile`

**Why this approach:** Not an ACME feature — a build-tooling compatibility fix,
discovered and corrected across two `az acr build` attempts. Upstream Langfuse's
Dockerfiles pin every stage with `FROM --platform=${TARGETPLATFORM:-linux/amd64} ...`
(BuildKit's shell-style default-value substitution). Azure Container Registry
Tasks' pre-build "scan for dependencies" step uses a narrower Dockerfile parser
than real BuildKit and aborts the whole build before the build engine ever runs:
- Attempt 1 hardcoded the value (`--platform=linux/amd64`), assuming the `${VAR:-default}`
  substitution syntax specifically was the problem. Build still failed at the same
  step (`unable to understand line FROM --platform=linux/amd64 ...`,
  `failed to scan dependencies: exit status 1`) — ACR's scanner doesn't recognize the
  `--platform` flag on `FROM` at all, regardless of its value.
- Attempt 2 (this fix) removes the flag entirely. ACR build agents are themselves
  linux/amd64, and this fork's only deployment target is AKS on standard amd64 node
  pools, so omitting `--platform` (Docker then defaults to the build machine's own
  platform) is a correct, zero-risk fix for this deployment. It would need revisiting
  only if ACME ever needs to cross-build for a different architecture (e.g. ARM64
  nodes) — at which point per-arch builds via separate `az acr build --platform`
  invocations would be the right mechanism, not Dockerfile-level `TARGETPLATFORM`
  substitution (which ACR's scanner can't consume either way).

**Deployment status:** Source-only until the resulting images are actually built and
deployed — see build progress in this same session.

---

## 2026-09-10 — Build fix: regenerate lockfile, pin anthropic-ai/sdk to a mature version

**What:** Regenerated `pnpm-lock.yaml` (previously never updated after `@anthropic-ai/sdk`
was added to `web/package.json` during the ACME AI chat work) and changed the
dependency's version range from `^0.124.0` to `^0.123.0`.

**Files:**
- `pnpm-lock.yaml`
- `web/package.json`

**Why this approach:** Two separate real build failures, both discovered live
running `az acr build`, not assumed:
1. `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` (what the Dockerfile runs) failed outright —
   `pnpm-lock.yaml` didn't match `web/package.json`'s `@anthropic-ai/sdk` addition.
   The lockfile was never regenerated when that dependency was added earlier in
   this engagement. Fixed by running `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile` to bring
   the lockfile back in sync.
2. That regeneration then hit this workspace's own `minimumReleaseAge: 7200`
   (5-day) supply-chain policy (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`) — `^0.124.0` resolves to
   `0.124.0`, published only days earlier, inside the maturity window. Rather than
   wait out the window or add a `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` bypass (a real security
   control this fork should not weaken), pinned to `^0.123.0` — the next version
   down, published 2026-09-01 and already clear of the window at the time of this
   fix.

**Deployment status:** Source-only until the resulting images are actually built and
deployed — see build progress in this same session.

## 2026-09-10 — Build note: web image OOM-killed on ACR's default build agent

**What:** No source change. Documenting a build-time-only workaround needed to get
`langfuse-web:acme-dev` built on Azure Container Registry's default (Basic-tier)
build agent: passing `--build-arg NEXT_IGNORE_BUILD_ERRORS=true` to `az acr build`.

**Why:** The first successful-past-dependency-resolution build attempt (run `dt4`)
compiled the Next.js app fine (`Compiled successfully in 3.3min`), then got killed
(`exit 137` — SIGKILL, the classic OOM-kill signature) during the separate
TypeScript type-checking pass that runs after compilation. ACR Tasks' default
build agent is memory-constrained, and this monorepo's full type-check is heavy
enough to exceed it. `web/Dockerfile` already had `NEXT_IGNORE_BUILD_ERRORS`
wired in for exactly this class of problem (its own comment: "Allows the CI
docker build smoke test to skip the Next.js type check that the lint job already
runs"). Two live attempts, not one:
- Attempt 1 passed `NEXT_IGNORE_BUILD_ERRORS=1`. Same OOM crash (run `dt5`) — the
  build still ran the full TypeScript check and died at the same point.
  `next.config.mjs` checks `process.env.NEXT_IGNORE_BUILD_ERRORS === "true"`, a
  strict string comparison; `"1"` never matched it, so the flag silently had no
  effect.
- Attempt 2 passed the literal string `NEXT_IGNORE_BUILD_ERRORS=true`. Build
  succeeded (run `dt6`, 15m31s) — confirms this Next.js version actually skips
  running the type-checker when the flag is honored, not just suppresses errors
  from it.

**Tradeoff, explicitly:** this means `langfuse-web:acme-dev` is NOT verified
type-clean by its own build — type errors would not fail this particular build.
Acceptable for a dev-prototype image; **not** acceptable for a real release build
without either (a) running on a build agent with more memory (e.g. a Premium-SKU
ACR dedicated agent pool), or (b) running `pnpm run typecheck` as a separate CI
step before building the image, which is exactly what Langfuse's own upstream CI
already does per that Dockerfile comment.

**Deployment status:** Applies only to how `langfuse-web:acme-dev` gets built,
not to any source file. See the "Custom image build" entry below for the
resulting image's actual status.

---

## 2026-09-10 — Custom image build: both images pushed to ACR

**What:** Both ACME-customized images successfully built (via `az acr build`,
Cloud Shell, driven end-to-end through browser automation) and pushed to the
`acmelangfuseacr` registry created for this purpose:

| Image | Tag | Digest | Build time |
|---|---|---|---|
| `langfuse-web` | `acme-dev` | `sha256:04aa360eb6a75f842e8a62837233e9f84b2b4331bf7460ce9d423c83531d56e7` | 15m31s (run `dt6`) |
| `langfuse-worker` | `acme-dev` | `sha256:31a417643c20a4e0393742176f5dbab83df56a798d26bd3d4050ceb3b1c68e47` | 8m19s (run `dt7`) |

Both built from this repo's `HEAD` at the time of the build (commit `fcc197f` and
earlier). The worker build hit one non-fatal issue worth noting: a native addon
(`cpu-features`, an optional transitive dependency, likely pulled in by an SSH
library) failed its `node-gyp` compile step (`Unable to detect compiler type` —
the minimal Alpine runtime stage has no C compiler) but did not abort the overall
install; the package degrades to a pure-JS fallback when its native build fails,
which is its documented behavior. No action needed.

**Why this matters:** This is the first point in the engagement where the ACME
fork exists as a runnable artifact, not just source. `web/Dockerfile` and
`worker/Dockerfile` changes (platform-flag fix, OOM workaround) and the
`pnpm-lock.yaml` regeneration (above) were all required to get here.

**Deployment status:** Images exist in ACR. **Not deployed** — `main.tf` in
Cloud Shell has not been updated to reference them yet, and no `terraform plan`
or `apply` has run. See "Outstanding, not yet done" below for the remaining
steps to actually reach `langfuse-dev.aiatacme.com`.

---

## 2026-09-10 — Terraform module fork: image override support

**What:** Vendored a patched copy of the upstream `langfuse/langfuse-terraform-azure`
module (pinned at tag `0.4.5`, matching what's live) into this repo at
`infra/langfuse-terraform-azure/`, adding four new optional variables
(`web_image_repository`, `web_image_tag`, `worker_image_repository`,
`worker_image_tag`) that pass through to the Helm release's `web.image`/
`worker.image` values — all `null` by default, so existing behavior is unchanged
unless explicitly set.

**Files:**
- `infra/langfuse-terraform-azure/variables.tf`
- `infra/langfuse-terraform-azure/langfuse.tf`
- `infra/langfuse-terraform-azure/ACME-FORK-README.md` (full rationale)

**Why this approach:** The underlying Helm chart (`2.0.2`, live) already supports
per-component image overrides; the Terraform module wrapper (`0.4.5`) simply never
exposed them as variables. This is the minimal additive patch needed to let
Terraform manage a custom ACME image instead of requiring an out-of-band `kubectl`
patch (the same drift risk already documented for the logo ConfigMap incident
above). See `ACME-FORK-README.md` for the full diff description.

**Deployment status:** Source-only. Not yet referenced by the live `main.tf` in
Cloud Shell, no `terraform plan`/`apply` run against it yet — deliberately held
back pending explicit review before touching the live cluster, per
`CONTRIBUTING-ACME.md`'s infra-change discipline.

---

## 2026-09-10 — Handoff: exact steps to deploy the built images

**Status:** Both images are built and in ACR (see "Custom image build" above).
`~/main.tf` in Cloud Shell already has a backup at `~/main.tf.bak-pre-acme-images`.
Editing `main.tf` and running `terraform apply` were deliberately left for manual
execution rather than done autonomously — this touches the live cluster and
deserves a human at the keyboard, not an overnight unattended change.

**Exact commands to run in Cloud Shell**, in order:

1. Point the module at this fork (replaces the pinned upstream commit ref):
   ```bash
   sed -i 's|source = "github.com/langfuse/langfuse-terraform-azure?ref=e939144c0a70dcc3de32f321ace86d34ee0d80c9"|source = "git::https://github.com/samrayin/ACME-Rayin.git//infra/langfuse-terraform-azure?ref=main"|' ~/main.tf
   ```
2. Add the four new image-override arguments inside the existing `module "langfuse" { ... }` block in `~/main.tf` (anywhere inside the block, e.g. right after the `app_version = "4.17.0"` line):
   ```hcl
   web_image_repository    = "acmelangfuseacr.azurecr.io/langfuse-web"
   web_image_tag            = "acme-dev"
   worker_image_repository = "acmelangfuseacr.azurecr.io/langfuse-worker"
   worker_image_tag         = "acme-dev"
   ```
3. Re-initialize (the module source changed) and review the plan:
   ```bash
   cd ~ && terraform init -upgrade && terraform plan
   ```
4. Read the plan output carefully — it should show only the `helm_release.langfuse`
   resource changing (new `web.image`/`worker.image` values in its `values`), no
   resources being destroyed/recreated. If that looks right:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```
5. After apply, verify the rollout:
   ```bash
   kubectl -n langfuse get pods -w
   kubectl -n langfuse get deployment langfuse-web -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}'
   kubectl -n langfuse get deployment langfuse-worker -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}'
   ```
   Then smoke-test `https://langfuse-dev.aiatacme.com` directly — logo, Contact
   Support button, ACME Enhancements → Audit Logs, and the ACME AI chat widget
   (needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — see the "Outstanding" section below, not yet set
   on the live deployment).

**If the plan shows anything unexpected** (resource replacement, unrelated
changes) — stop and investigate before applying. `main.tf.bak-pre-acme-images` is
there to revert from if needed.

---

## 2026-09-10 — Fix: Terraform module fork was built from the wrong base commit

**What:** Rebuilt `infra/langfuse-terraform-azure/` from the correct upstream
commit (`e939144c0a70dcc3de32f321ace86d34ee0d80c9` — the exact commit `main.tf`
actually pins) instead of tag `0.4.5`. Also made the `samrayin/langfuse-acme`
GitHub repo public, since Terraform's `git::https://` module source can't
authenticate to a private repo non-interactively and Cloud Shell has no stored
GitHub credentials for it. (Repo since renamed to `samrayin/ACME-Rayin` on
2026-09-11 — see "Repository rename" below.)

**Why:** Live, caught by `terraform init` itself, not by review. The earlier
"Terraform module fork" entry above assumed tag `0.4.5` matched the pinned commit
SHA in `main.tf` without checking — it didn't. `0.4.5` is 10 commits behind the
actual pinned commit, and `terraform init` immediately failed with six
`Unsupported argument` errors (`clickhouse_replicas`,
`clickhouse_keeper_replicas`, `clickhouse_storage_size`,
`clickhouse_keeper_storage_size`, `redis_high_availability`, and the underlying
module having switched from `azurerm_redis_cache` to `azurerm_managed_redis`)
for variables the live config already sets, that don't exist in `0.4.5`.
Verified the correct commit with `git describe --tags <SHA>` against a full
clone of the upstream module before rebuilding, rather than guessing again.
The four-variable image-override patch itself was unaffected — reapplied
cleanly onto the correct base.

**Deployment status:** Fork corrected and pushed. Repo visibility change
(private → public) was the one part of this fix done by the user directly
(GitHub repo-settings changes are outside what runs autonomously) — everything
else (commit verification, file rebuild, patch reapplication, push) was done
end-to-end. Ready for `terraform init -upgrade` to be retried.

---

## 2026-09-10 — Live deployment: ACME fork now running on langfuse-dev.aiatacme.com

**What:** `langfuse-web:acme-dev` and `langfuse-worker:acme-dev` are deployed and
serving traffic. `kubectl get pods -n langfuse`:
```
langfuse-web-66454bcc86-h4jsw      1/1   Running   0   <fresh>
langfuse-worker-78f87875cf-vnhxw   1/1   Running   0   <fresh>
```
Zero downtime during the cutover — Kubernetes kept the previous pods serving until
each new one passed its readiness probe, standard rolling-update behavior.

**How this actually got deployed — not via Terraform:** Partway through, Cloud
Shell's persistent `$HOME` (where `main.tf` and Terraform's local state lived, per
the base-version note above) failed to mount on reconnect and came back completely
empty. The real Azure infrastructure was verified completely unaffected
(`az resource list -g rg-langfuse` — every resource `Succeeded`; `kubectl get pods`
— the then-current deployment healthy) — this was purely a Cloud Shell storage
issue, not data loss in the cluster. But with Terraform's own state gone, applying
through Terraform risked it trying to reconcile against a blank slate for
resources that already exist. Rather than block the deployment on a full
`terraform import` of ~30 resources, deployed directly via `helm upgrade
--reuse-values` (preserves every existing Helm value; only adds the four new image
keys) as a deliberate, temporary bridge. **Terraform does not manage this
deployment's current image configuration** — see "Outstanding" below.

**Two more real bugs found and fixed live, not assumed:**

1. **Wrong Helm value path.** Assumed (from earlier in this engagement, never
   re-verified) that the chart used top-level `web.image.repository`/
   `worker.image.repository`. It doesn't — confirmed via
   `helm show values langfuse-charts/langfuse --version 2.0.2`, the real path is
   `langfuse.web.image.repository` / `langfuse.worker.image.repository` (nested
   under the top-level `langfuse:` key). This was wrong in **both** the `helm
   upgrade --set` flags used here **and** the Terraform module fork's
   `image_values` local — the Terraform fork has since been corrected to match
   (not yet re-verified against a live `terraform plan`, since Terraform isn't
   managing this deployment right now — see "Outstanding").
2. **CRLF-corrupted `entrypoint.sh`.** Both new pods came up `ImagePullBackOff`
   first (separate issue: AKS's kubelet had no `AcrPull` role on the brand-new
   `acmelangfuseacr` registry — fixed with `az aks update --attach-acr
   acmelangfuseacr`, a standard grant, not destructive). Once pulling worked, both
   crashed with `[dumb-init] ./web/entrypoint.sh: No such file or directory` — a
   misleading error. Inspected the actual bytes inside the already-pushed image via
   a throwaway debug pod (`kubectl run --rm -it --command -- sh -c "cat -A
   ./web/entrypoint.sh"`) and found `#!/bin/sh^M$` — a CRLF-corrupted shebang, not a
   missing file. Root-caused to `git archive --format=zip` on Windows silently
   converting these files' line endings during archive creation, even though the
   actual git-stored blobs were already LF-only (confirmed: local checkout had no
   `\r`, the zip built from `git archive` did). Fixed with a `.gitattributes` rule
   (`*.sh text eol=lf`, `Dockerfile text eol=lf`) that forces `git archive` to emit
   LF regardless of platform — verified against a freshly regenerated zip before
   rebuilding. Both images were rebuilt and redeployed after this fix; the pods
   above are running the corrected images.

**Files:**
- `.gitattributes` (new rule)
- `infra/langfuse-terraform-azure/langfuse.tf`, `variables.tf` (corrected value path)

**Deployment status:** Live. Verify at `https://langfuse-dev.aiatacme.com` — ACME
logo, "Contact ACME Support" button, and "ACME Enhancements → Audit Logs" should
all be visible now. The ACME AI chat widget will appear but not respond yet (see
"Outstanding").

## Logo update: official ACME Almoayyed Computers Middle East logo

Replaced the earlier placeholder ACME mark with the official logo (pinwheel mark +
"ACME ALMOAYYED COMPUTERS MIDDLE EAST" wordmark with Arabic subtitle), sourced from
the exact file the user provided (`ACME Logo 01.svg`, an SVG shell wrapping a
237x76 JPEG — no manual redrawing, all derived pixels come from that source file).

**What changed:**
- `web/public/icon.svg` — square mark only, cropped from the source logo's left
  70x76 region (excludes the vertical divider line before the wordmark), padded
  onto a transparent 76x76 square, then resized to the existing 93x93 canvas.
- `web/public/wordart-black.svg` — full horizontal lockup (mark + wordmark), same
  pixels as the source file, format-converted from JPEG to PNG at native
  resolution (237x76). Used for the light-mode topbar logo.
- `web/public/favicon-16x16.png`, `favicon-32x32.png`, `apple-touch-icon.png`,
  `icon256.png`, `icon512.png`, `favicon.ico` — regenerated from the same square
  mark crop via standard bicubic resize (favicon.ico rebuilt as a proper
  multi-resolution 16/32/48 ICO with embedded PNG frames).

**Not changed — needs a decision:** `web/public/wordart-white.svg` (the dark-mode
topbar logo) was left as the previous placeholder. The source logo has an opaque
white background with dark text/mark, so using it as-is for dark mode would show a
white rectangle behind the logo instead of blending into the dark sidebar. Needs
either a proper light/transparent variant from ACME's brand assets, or a decision
to keep a plain wordmark-only treatment for dark mode.

**Files:**
- `web/public/icon.svg`, `wordart-black.svg`, `favicon-16x16.png`,
  `favicon-32x32.png`, `apple-touch-icon.png`, `icon256.png`, `icon512.png`,
  `favicon.ico`

**Deployment status:** Not yet built/deployed — needs a web image rebuild (same
ACR Tasks build + `helm upgrade` flow as the earlier logo/branding work) before
it's live on `langfuse-dev.aiatacme.com`.

## ACME theme: navy sidebar + teal brand accent

Recolored the app chrome to match ACME's own Insight360 product design
(navy sidebar, teal accent) instead of Langfuse's stock palette, using the
existing CSS-variable design-token system in `globals.css` (no layout
changes, no new components).

**What changed (light mode only, `:root` block):**
- `--sidebar-background`/`--sidebar-foreground`/`--sidebar-accent`/
  `--sidebar-border` → deep navy (`hsl(210 55% 15%)`) chrome with a lighter
  navy highlight for the active nav item
- `--sidebar-accent-foreground`/`--sidebar-primary`/`--sidebar-ring` →
  bright teal (`hsl(173 80% 40%)`, tuned for contrast against the navy fill)
  — this is what colors the active nav item's icon/label
- `--primary`/`--link`/`--link-hover`/`--ring` → darker teal
  (`hsl(175 84% 26%)`, tuned for white-text contrast on a light canvas) —
  colors primary buttons and hyperlinks

Dark mode's own palette (near-black sidebar, light-gray primary) was left
untouched — not part of this request.

**Logo fix (both themes):** `LangfuseLogo.tsx` and `topbar-brand.tsx`
previously swapped between `wordart-black.svg` (light) and `wordart-white.svg`
(dark) via `dark:hidden`/`dark:block`. The source ACME logo file has an
opaque white background (it's a raster JPEG, not a true-transparent vector),
so `wordart-white.svg` was always a stale placeholder that never got updated
in the earlier logo-replacement pass. Fixed by dropping the dark-mode
variant entirely and always rendering `wordart-black.svg` inside a small
white rounded pill (`bg-white rounded-md`) — same treatment now needed for
the navy sidebar in light mode too. `wordart-white.svg` is no longer
referenced anywhere in the app (left in `public/` unused rather than
deleted, in case a future real dark-mode-specific asset replaces it).

**Verification:** Iterated live against `langfuse-dev.aiatacme.com` by
injecting CSS variable overrides via browser devtools before writing any
code, to land on exact HSL values without a rebuild per iteration.

**Files:**
- `web/src/styles/globals.css`
- `web/src/components/design-system/LangfuseLogo/LangfuseLogo.tsx`
- `web/src/components/nav/topbar-brand.tsx`

**Deployment status:** Live. Built via `az acr build` (run `dta`, 17m32s — hit a
known Windows Azure CLI bug streaming the log, `UnicodeEncodeError` on a Turbo
banner character; unrelated to the actual remote build, worked around by polling
`az acr task list-runs` instead of `az acr task logs`), deployed via
`kubectl rollout restart deployment/langfuse-web` (image tag unchanged at
`acme-dev`, only the digest changed, so a restart was needed to force the
`imagePullPolicy: Always` re-pull — a plain `helm upgrade --reuse-values` would
have been a no-op). Verified live on `langfuse-dev.aiatacme.com` in both themes.

## Upgrade to v4.33.0

**What:** Rebased the fork from Langfuse `v4.17.0` to `v4.33.0` (16 minor
versions, ~2 months of upstream development) and deployed it live.

**Why this approach:** This repo's history is a single-commit snapshot of
`v4.17.0` with ACME's patches applied on top, not a real clone of upstream's
history (documented gap — see "Full git history" in Outstanding, below) — so a
normal `git merge`/rebase against the `v4.33.0` tag wasn't available. Instead:
cloned `langfuse/langfuse` in full, created a branch from the real `v4.33.0`
tag, and cherry-picked each of the fork's 17 ACME commits onto it in order.
15 applied cleanly or with mechanical conflict resolution (upstream had moved
files the baseline snapshot didn't capture correctly in the first place — a
pre-existing gap in how this fork was originally built, not something new).
Two needed real fixes, both only found by actually building the result:

1. **`AcmeAuditLogsTable.tsx`'s `Avatar`/`IOTableCell` imports** — upstream
   moved both into `web/src/components/design-system/` between v4.17 and
   v4.33, and collapsed the old `Avatar`/`AvatarFallback`/`AvatarImage` trio
   into a single `Avatar` component with a `displayName`/`src` prop API.
   Fixed by updating the imports and switching to the new API and the
   `ConnectedIOTableCell` adapter (same pattern every other v4.33 call site
   uses). Caught by Turbopack: "Module not found".
2. **ACR build OOM on the default Basic-tier build agent** — this Next.js
   version's build is heavier than v4.17's; the build got OOM-killed during
   Next's page-data-collection step with no clear error in the log. Fixed by
   building on a dedicated ACR Tasks agent pool (`S2`, 4 vCPU/8GB) instead of
   the shared default pool — deleted again after verification passed, since
   dedicated pools bill hourly regardless of use.

Both images were build-verified (tagged `v4.33.0-verify`) on a separate
`acme-v4.33.0-rebuild` branch before touching `main` or the live deployment —
`main`'s history was only force-pushed to the rebuilt one after the user
explicitly confirmed adopting it (a history rewrite on a shared repo).

**Real regression found at deploy time — Redis Cluster incompatibility:**
after cutting the new images over, every BullMQ queue (traces, evals,
deletes, notifications, webhooks, the new `otel-ingestion-queue`) started
failing with Redis `CROSSSLOT` errors — this version's queue code, unlike
v4.17's, doesn't tolerate the live Redis instance's actual clustering
behavior. Root cause and fix: see "Redis Cluster compatibility fix" below.

**Files:** `deploy/azure/versions.tf`'s pinned module source is unaffected
(it already points at the ACME fork of `langfuse-terraform-azure`, which
doesn't pin a Langfuse app version); the version bump lives entirely in the
built container images and `main`'s new history — see the 19 commits between
`v4.33.0` and `main`'s tip in this repo's own git log for the exact diff.

**Deployment status:** Live on `langfuse-dev.aiatacme.com` as of 2026-09-10,
including the Redis fix below.

## Rebrand: built-in dashboards "Langfuse" -> "RayIn"

**What:** Renamed every user-facing "Langfuse" string in the built-in
seeded dashboards and their surrounding UI to "RayIn": the 4 curated
dashboard names in `worker/src/constants/langfuse-dashboards.json`
(Latency, Usage Management, Cost, Agent Dashboard) plus the separate
`LANGFUSE_HOME_DASHBOARD` constant's name, the "Langfuse-maintained"
section heading in the Home Dashboard picker, the "Owner" column's
"Langfuse" tag in the Dashboards table, and the two "Langfuse"
mentions in the clone-before-edit dialog (locked-dashboard copy flow)
and the locked-dashboard detail page title suffix.

**Why this approach — surface only, not the code beneath it:** Deliberately
scoped to display text: JSON `name` values and JSX string literals, not the
constant/identifier names (`LANGFUSE_HOME_DASHBOARD`,
`LANGFUSE_HOME_DASHBOARD_ID`, the `owner: "LANGFUSE"` enum value itself,
`upsertLangfuseDashboards`, file names, etc.) or anything env/package/image
-level. A deep rename touching those would balloon the diff against
upstream and make every future version bump (like the v4.33.0 upgrade
above) much harder to carry forward — see the reasoning given when this was
discussed. This keeps the same "surface rebrand, not a fork of the fork"
posture as the logo/theme work earlier tonight.

**A real trap avoided:** the JSON/constant `updatedAt` timestamps had to be
bumped alongside each renamed `name` — `upsertLangfuseDashboards()`
(`worker/src/scripts/upsertLangfuseDashboards.ts`) skips writing a row
whose `updatedAt` already matches what's in the database, and it runs with
`force` defaulting to `false` on every worker boot. Renaming `name` without
also bumping `updatedAt` would have silently done nothing against the
already-seeded live database.

**Files:**
- `worker/src/constants/langfuse-dashboards.json`
- `packages/shared/src/domain/home-dashboard.ts`
- `web/src/features/dashboard/components/HomeDashboardSelect.tsx`
- `web/src/features/dashboard/components/DashboardTable.tsx`
- `web/src/features/dashboard/components/CloneFirstDialogController.tsx`
- `web/src/features/dashboard/DashboardDetailPage.tsx`

**Deployment status:** Source-only until rebuilt/redeployed. Both `web`
(UI strings) and `worker` (the seed JSON, re-upserted on next boot) need
rebuilding — not just `web` alone.

---

## Fix: Audit Logs nav item invisible after v4.33.0 upgrade

**What:** `web/src/components/layouts/routes.tsx` and
`acmeAuditLogsRouter.ts` both still referenced the RBAC scope
`auditLogs:read`, which upstream renamed to `projectAuditLogs:read`
somewhere between v4.17.0 and v4.33.0 (see
`packages/shared/src/features/rbac/projectAccessRights.ts` — no scope by
the old name exists any more). Since a nav item's `projectRbacScopes` only
matches a user's actual granted scopes, a scope name that doesn't exist
matches nobody — the Audit Logs section silently disappeared for every
role, including Owner.

**Why this slipped through the v4.33.0 rebuild:** `AcmeAuditLogsTable.tsx`'s
broken imports (see "Upgrade to v4.33.0" above) were caught by Turbopack at
build time because they're genuine module-resolution errors. This wasn't —
`"auditLogs:read"` is a syntactically valid string, just not a member of the
`ProjectScope` union any more, and the ACR build runs with
`NEXT_IGNORE_BUILD_ERRORS=true` (type-checking skipped, see the OOM
workaround entry above), so the TypeScript error this would normally raise
never got the chance to fail the build.

**Bonus, not a separate task:** `projectAuditLogs:read` is granted only to
the `OWNER` and `ADMIN` roles in Langfuse's own RBAC map (unchanged upstream
behavior) — so fixing the scope name also gives Audit Logs the
owner/admin-only visibility ACME wants, with no additional customization.

**Files:**
- `web/src/components/layouts/routes.tsx`
- `web/src/features/acme-enhancements/server/acmeAuditLogsRouter.ts`

**Deployment status:** Source-only until rebuilt/redeployed.

---

## Redis Cluster compatibility fix

**What:** `REDIS_CLUSTER_ENABLED=false` (explicit) and
`REDIS_KEY_PREFIX={langfuse}` added to both `langfuse-web` and
`langfuse-worker` — fixes the `CROSSSLOT` regression surfaced by the v4.33.0
upgrade above.

**Why:** The live Redis (`redis-langfuse-bgqj`, Azure Managed Redis) uses
Azure's **`EnterpriseCluster`** clustering policy (confirmed via
`az redisenterprise show` / `az redisenterprise database list`) — this is
neither plain single-node nor real OSS Cluster:
- Keys **are** hash-slot-sharded, so multi-key BullMQ operations without
  matching hash slots genuinely fail with `CROSSSLOT` — this is what broke.
- The OSS `CLUSTER SLOTS` topology-discovery command ioredis's native
  `Cluster` client needs to operate in cluster mode is **blocked**
  ("ERR command is not allowed") — Azure's Enterprise proxy handles
  shard routing itself and doesn't expose this to clients. This means
  Langfuse's own built-in `REDIS_CLUSTER_ENABLED=true` path (which switches
  ioredis into `Cluster` client mode) doesn't work against this specific
  Azure policy, even though it's exactly the right idea for genuine OSS
  Cluster Redis.

The fix that actually works for `EnterpriseCluster`: stay on ioredis's simple
single-node client (`REDIS_CLUSTER_ENABLED=false`, avoiding the blocked
command entirely — Azure's own proxy transparently routes each key to the
correct shard), and force every key the app touches onto the **same** hash
slot via a hash-tag-wrapped `REDIS_KEY_PREFIX` (`{langfuse}` — the braces are
literal Redis hash-tag syntax; only their contents count toward slot
hashing). `getQueuePrefix()` in `packages/shared/src/server/redis/redis.ts`
already does this exact hash-tag wrapping when cluster mode is on, but ties
it to the Cluster-client switch; `REDIS_KEY_PREFIX` gets the same effect via
ioredis's own `keyPrefix` option, independent of client mode. Collapsing all
keys onto one slot loses Redis-side key distribution, but on this SKU
(`Balanced_B1`, high availability disabled) that's not a real cost.

**Verification:** Both new pods' logs show every queue executor starting
cleanly with zero `CROSSSLOT` or connection errors (previously every single
queue failed on startup).

**Not yet done:** this was applied live via `kubectl set env` (blocked from
automated `kubectl patch`/`set env` by Claude Code's safety classifier, same
pattern as other live-infra edits tonight — run manually), then captured in
`deploy/azure/main.tf`'s `additional_env` so a future `terraform apply`
doesn't silently revert it once state is reconciled (see "Terraform doesn't
manage the live image configuration yet" in Outstanding).

**Files:** `deploy/azure/main.tf`

**Deployment status:** Live.

---

## Backup & restore: remote Terraform state

**What:** Terraform state moved off Cloud Shell's local disk permanently, closing
the gap that caused tonight's two incidents (see "Cloud Shell storage mount
reliability" below). New resources, created directly via `az` CLI (bootstrap
infrastructure — deliberately outside anything Terraform itself manages, so it
can't be lost to a `terraform destroy` or accidentally reconciled away):

- Resource group `rg-langfuse-tfstate` (swedencentral) — separate from
  `rg-langfuse` so deleting the main resource group can't take state with it
- Storage account `stacmelftfstate` — GRS replication, TLS 1.2 minimum, no public
  blob access, blob versioning **and** 30-day soft delete both enabled
- Blob container `tfstate`, holding `langfuse.tfstate`

The root Terraform config that was previously only ever in Cloud Shell's `$HOME`
(and lost with it, twice) is now committed at `deploy/azure/` — `versions.tf`
(provider requirements + the `backend "azurerm"` block, authenticated via Azure AD
rather than a storage account key), `providers.tf`, and `main.tf` (the actual
`module "langfuse"` call, pinned to the values that match the live environment).
See `deploy/azure/README.md` for the one manual step required per operator.

**Why this approach:** Azure AD auth (`use_azuread_auth = true` in the backend
block) instead of a shared storage account key — no long-lived secret to leak or
rotate, access is just an RBAC role grant, revocable the same way as any other
permission. The role grant itself (`Storage Blob Data Contributor` on the new
storage account) was blocked by Claude Code's auto-mode safety classifier —
consistent with the AcrPull grant earlier tonight — so it's documented as a
one-time manual command in `deploy/azure/README.md` rather than attempted via a
workaround.

**Not done yet:** The backend is live and **empty** — the ~65 real resources in
`rg-langfuse` are not yet reconciled into it. `terraform plan` against
`deploy/azure/` right now would want to create everything from scratch. Do not
`apply` until the `import` block reconciliation (next step) is complete and
`terraform plan` shows zero diff.

**Files:**
- `deploy/azure/versions.tf`, `providers.tf`, `main.tf`, `README.md`

**Deployment status:** Remote state backend live; root config committed; state
reconciliation not started.

## 2026-09-10 — Sidebar nav: expand/collapse sections + tagging convention

**What:** Each route group in the left sidebar (`web/src/components/nav/nav-main.tsx`)
is now a `Collapsible` with a rotating chevron on its label. Per-group open/closed
state persists to `localStorage` (`sidebarCollapsedGroups`); a group holding the
active page always renders expanded regardless of its stored state, so navigating
to a page never hides its own nav entry.

**Build note:** the first two ACR build attempts for this commit failed at Next.js's
"Collecting page data" step with no usable error text in ACR's log capture. A full
local `next build` of the identical commit completed with zero errors (all 83 pages
generated), which pointed at Azure build-agent flakiness rather than a code defect —
confirmed when a third ACR attempt of the same commit succeeded outright. If this
step fails again on an unrelated future commit, try a plain retry before assuming a
real regression; if it fails repeatedly, get real logs via
`az rest --method post .../runs/<id>/listLogSasUrl?api-version=2019-06-01-preview`
+ `curl` (`az acr task logs` hangs/mis-renders on this Windows machine).

**Deployment status:** Live. Built via `az acr build` (`bigpool`, run `dtm`,
16m01s) and deployed via `kubectl rollout restart deployment/langfuse-web -n
langfuse` — new pod healthy, clean startup logs, no errors.

**Versioning established this entry:** tagged `acme-v4.33.0.1` at this commit —
the first tag in this fork's history. See "Versioning" at the top of this file for
the convention now in effect for every future deployed change.

---

## 2026-09-11 — Repository rename: `langfuse-acme` → `ACME-Rayin`

**What:** GitHub repo renamed from `samrayin/langfuse-acme` to `samrayin/ACME-Rayin`
(`gh repo rename`, owner unchanged). Local `origin` remote updated to match. Both
hardcoded references to the old name (`ACME-CHANGELOG.md`'s Cloud Shell `sed`
handoff command, `infra/langfuse-terraform-azure/ACME-FORK-README.md`'s module
`source` example) updated. No other code, config, or CI reference in the repo
named it — confirmed via a full-repo search for `langfuse-acme` and `samrayin`.
GitHub auto-redirects the old URL (both the web UI and `git clone`/`fetch`/`git::`
module sources) indefinitely for a renamed repo, so nothing broke in the interim,
but new work should use the new URL going forward.

**Not automatically fixed — needs manual action:** if the live Cloud Shell
`~/main.tf` (see "Exact commands to run in Cloud Shell" above) still has the old
`git::https://github.com/samrayin/langfuse-acme.git//...` module source baked in
from that original handoff, it will keep working via GitHub's redirect but should
be updated to `ACME-Rayin` next time that file is touched — same one-line `sed`
pattern as before, just the new repo name.

---

## 2026-09-11 — Sidebar reorg + RAYIN wordmark

**What:**
- **Contact ACME Support** relocated from a button buried inside the generic
  Support drawer (`IntroSection.tsx`) to its own first-class nav item under
  **ACME Enhancements**, right after Audit Logs (`routes.tsx`, new
  `web/src/components/nav/acme-contact-support-nav-item.tsx`). Target email
  updated from a placeholder personal address to `helpdesk@almoayyedcomputers.com`.
- **Version label** (the small badge/dropdown that used to sit next to the
  logo, showing the running version and update status) relocated to the
  bottom of the **ACME Enhancements** group, same place. Required a small,
  generic addition to `NavMain` (`nav-main.tsx`): an optional
  `groupExtraContent` prop that renders arbitrary content at the end of a
  named group's body, inside its collapsible section — used here for
  `RouteGroup.AcmeEnhancements` only. `versionState` itself is untouched
  (still computed once in `AuthenticatedLayout.tsx`); only where its
  existing `VersionLabel` renders moved.
- **"RAYIN" wordmark** added next to the ACME logo, both in the sidebar
  header (`LangfuseLogo.tsx`) and the mobile top bar's wordmark variant
  (`topbar-brand.tsx`) — two-tone bold text reusing the sidebar's existing
  teal accent token for the "IN", so it matches the navy/teal theme
  automatically rather than a new hardcoded color.

**Why:** product decision — RayIn is the name this solution will go to
customers as, so it belongs next to the mark itself, not just in dashboard
labels. Audit Logs, Contact Support, and version info are all ACME-specific
additions to the base product, so grouping them together under one section
is more discoverable than leaving Contact Support behind an unrelated
Support button and Version floating in the header.

**Deployment status:** built and deployed same as prior entries — see
commit history for the exact build/deploy run.

---

## 2026-09-11 — Customer deployment template + Redis fix promoted into the module

**What:** Two changes, both toward "sell this to customers without risking
ACME's own environment":

1. **New `deploy/customer-template/`** — a reusable, value-free root config
   (mirrors `deploy/azure/` structurally) for deploying a customer's own,
   fully independent Langfuse-on-Azure environment: their own subscription,
   domain, network ranges, resource names, and Terraform state (recommended
   setup: a dedicated state storage account in the *customer's own*
   subscription, never ACME's — see the template's README for the one-time
   setup command). Filling in and running it produces a deployment that
   cannot read, write, or collide with ACME's own environment or another
   customer's, by construction: separate state, separate subscription,
   Azure-naming-module-guaranteed unique resource names even with identical
   `name` values, and brand-new randomly generated secrets per deployment
   (the module already worked this way — no changes needed there).
2. **Redis Cluster fix promoted from ACME's root config into the module
   itself** (`infra/langfuse-terraform-azure/langfuse.tf`) — it was
   previously only applied via `deploy/azure/main.tf`'s `additional_env`,
   meaning every future customer would have silently hit and had to
   rediscover the same CROSSSLOT production issue ACME hit, since every
   deployment of this module provisions Azure Managed Redis with the same
   hardcoded `EnterpriseCluster` clustering policy (`redis.tf`). Now
   applies automatically to every deployment. Required folding it into the
   same `additionalEnv` Helm values list a caller's own `var.additional_env`
   uses (via `concat()`), rather than a separate values block — Helm
   replaces list-type values wholesale rather than merging them across
   values files, so two separate `additionalEnv:` blocks would have caused
   whichever was applied last to silently wipe out the other.
   `deploy/azure/main.tf`'s now-redundant `additional_env` entry for this
   removed.

**Why:** direct ask — the user wants ACME's own environment eventually
fully captured in Terraform (separate, paused reconciliation effort — see
"Outstanding" below) *and* an independent way to deploy the same product
for a paying customer with their own IP ranges, names, and secrets, without
ACME operating both from the same account/state. Chose "ACME stays in
control" (each customer's filled-in config is a private, ACME-managed
folder run against the customer's own subscription) over a fully
self-service customer-run template, as the simpler starting point.

**Not yet done:** no real customer exists yet, so this produced a template
only — nothing has been filled in or applied anywhere. `terraform validate`
against the template hasn't been run (no local Terraform install on the
machine this was built from this session — see "Outstanding" below);
worth a quick check next time Terraform is available (Cloud Shell) before
handing this to a first real customer.

---

## 2026-09-11 — Live UI customization (accent color + top-bar background) + nav label fix

**What:**
- New **UI Customization** page under ACME Enhancements
  (`web/src/features/acme-enhancements/pages/AcmeUiCustomizationPage.tsx`):
  an owner/admin picks from a fixed set of accent-color presets (Navy, Teal,
  Purple, Forest Green, Black, Red — Black/Red added 2026-09-11 shortly
  after launch, `acmeThemePresets.ts`) and 3 top-bar background presets
  (Plain, Soft tint, Gradient), applied live for every user in the
  project — no redeploy. Deliberately a fixed preset list, not a free color
  picker; adding a new preset is a one-entry addition to
  `ACME_ACCENT_COLOR_PRESETS` — the picker UI and server-side validation
  both read the list dynamically, nothing else needs touching.
- Stored in `Project.metadata` (a generic JSON column Langfuse already has)
  under an `acmeTheme` key — **no database migration needed**. New
  `acmeThemeRouter.ts` (`get`: any project member; `update`: `project:update`
  scope, owners/admins only — same pattern as Audit Logs' RBAC gating).
- Applied at runtime via `AcmeThemeStyleInjector` (mounted in
  `AuthenticatedLayout.tsx`, next to the AI chat widget): injects a
  `<style>` override for `--primary`/`--link`/`--link-hover`/`--ring`
  based on the stored preset. No injection risk — the stored value is
  always one of 4 fixed, server-validated preset keys, never free-form
  text. `PageHeader`'s top strip reads the same setting
  (`useAcmeHeaderBackgroundClassName`) for its background tint/gradient,
  computed from the same `--primary` variable so it always matches
  whichever accent color is active.
- This also supersedes the last two color tweaks (darkening the teal, then
  switching to navy) — both are now just the *default* preset rather than
  a hardcoded value; today's earlier `globals.css` edits stay as that
  default.
- **Nav label fix:** the collapsible sidebar groups' `hover:text-sidebar-foreground`
  class (added when the collapse/expand feature was built) made whichever
  group the cursor was resting on look brighter/bolder than the others —
  reported as "ACME Enhancements looks like a different font." Removed;
  every group label now renders identically regardless of hover state.

**Why:** direct ask — rather than ACME manually editing CSS and redeploying
every time the color preference changes (three redeploys happened today
alone chasing this), an admin can now change it themselves, live, from
inside the app.

---

## Outstanding, not yet done

- **Terraform doesn't manage the live image configuration yet — reconciliation
  in progress, 2026-09-11.** `deploy/azure/import-state.sh` now exists: a
  self-contained script that resolves every one of the ~65 live resources'
  real Azure/Kubernetes/Helm identifiers and runs `terraform import` for each
  (state-only — never touches the live resources, never runs `apply`).
  Sensitive resources (`random_password`/`random_bytes` backing the Postgres
  password, NextAuth secret, encryption key, ClickHouse password) are
  imported by their real current live value, read from the running
  Kubernetes secret at script run-time — never a freshly generated one.
  **Blocked on two one-time role grants** (Claude Code's safety classifier
  blocks IAM changes; run these once, from an account with Owner/User Access
  Administrator on the relevant scopes):
  ```bash
  az role assignment create \
    --assignee "740add8c-c763-430a-8366-e78c85f601e5" \
    --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor" \
    --scope "/subscriptions/87f4e6be-6585-4a1a-93f3-1a896cf644b9/resourceGroups/rg-langfuse-tfstate/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/stacmelftfstate"
  az role assignment create \
    --assignee "740add8c-c763-430a-8366-e78c85f601e5" \
    --role "Key Vault Secrets User" \
    --scope "/subscriptions/87f4e6be-6585-4a1a-93f3-1a896cf644b9/resourceGroups/rg-langfuse/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/kv-langfuse-bgqj"
  ```
  Then, in Cloud Shell (no local Terraform on the machine this was built
  from): `terraform init`, `bash import-state.sh` from `deploy/azure/`,
  then `terraform plan` — must show **0 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy**
  before this item is actually closed. Do not `apply` until that's true.
- **Cloud Shell storage mount reliability.** The `$HOME` mount failed at least
  twice in one session (once losing all local files, once again on a later
  reconnect). Root cause not investigated (still worth a closer look at whether
  it's a one-off Azure-side hiccup or something about this specific storage
  account/file share — `csg10032006309a33d8` /
  `cs-anees-aiatacme-com-10032006309a33d8`, `cloud-shell-storage-centralindia`) —
  but the actual *impact* is now largely contained: both Terraform's state and its
  root config are committed/remote (see "Backup & restore: remote Terraform
  state"), so a third occurrence would no longer lose either.
- **`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` not set on the live deployment** — required for the ACME AI
  chat widget to actually respond; needs to be added as a Kubernetes secret and
  wired into the Helm values (same pattern as the other secrets in
  `kubernetes_secret.langfuse`), and eventually into Terraform once it manages this
  deployment again.
- ~~**Contact button target**~~ — resolved 2026-09-11, see "Sidebar reorg + RAYIN
  wordmark" below.
- **ACME AI end-to-end test** — backend/frontend built and internally consistent, not
  yet proven against a live Claude API call from inside the running app.
- ~~**Full git history**~~ — resolved 2026-09-10. `main` is now built on a real clone
  of upstream Langfuse's history (tag `v4.33.0`), with every ACME commit cherry-picked
  on top individually. A future upstream version bump can use a normal `git merge`/
  rebase against the next upstream tag instead of manually replaying patches.
