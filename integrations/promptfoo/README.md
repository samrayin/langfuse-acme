# promptfoo — adversarial red-teaming and eval for RAYIN

**Status: scaffolded 2026-09-12, not yet run against the live cluster.** Config
files exist and are believed correct against the live environment as of this
date, but per [CONTRIBUTING-ACME.md](../../CONTRIBUTING-ACME.md#before-marking-anything-done)
this is "committed," not "deployed" — nothing here is marked done until it has
actually been run against `rayin-guardrails` and LiteLLM and produced a real,
inspected result.

See `promptfoo-deployment-runbook.md` in the companion `Azure Blueprint` docs
folder (outside this git repository, alongside `Azure.md` and
`ENVIRONMENT-STUDY.md`) for the full phase-by-phase runbook this README
summarizes, including the verified live-environment facts, the exact
commands, and the reasoning behind every decision below. That document is the
source of truth; this README is the operational quick-reference committed
alongside the actual config.

## What it is

[promptfoo](https://www.promptfoo.dev/) is an open-source LLM eval and
red-teaming CLI: it generates adversarial/test inputs, sends them to a target,
and grades the response — either deterministically or with an LLM judge. It's
config-driven (YAML + a CLI), not application code this repo maintains.

## Why RAYIN needs it — and what it must NOT do

This project already built one redundant guardrail once (a native LiteLLM
Presidio integration, reverted — see `integrations/litellm/PII-DECISION.md`)
and isn't repeating that mistake here. The boundary:

| Capability | Owned by | promptfoo's role |
|---|---|---|
| PII detection & redaction | **rayin-guardrails** (Presidio) | Do not reimplement. Only assert it fires. |
| Jailbreak / topical rail logic | **rayin-guardrails** (NeMo) | Do not reimplement. **Attack it.** |
| Model routing, budgets, virtual keys | **LiteLLM** | None. Consume as a provider. |
| Trace capture, cost, session analytics | **RAYIN/Langfuse** | None. Use as the results sink. |
| Adversarial attack generation | nobody, until now | ✅ promptfoo |
| Fail-open detection under paraphrase | nobody, until now | ✅ promptfoo |
| Prompt-injection resistance testing | nobody, until now | ✅ promptfoo |
| Hallucination / faithfulness eval | nobody, until now | ✅ promptfoo |
| CI regression gate on eval scores | nobody, until now | ✅ promptfoo |

Rule of thumb: **promptfoo generates inputs and judges outputs. It never sits
in a request path.** An internal due-diligence audit (2026-09-12) flagged
"zero adversarial testing has ever been run against the rail-flow logic" as a
real, currently-open gap — that's the gap this closes.

## Known blockers, read before running anything

1. **`rayin-guardrails`' rail-flow path is currently broken** — no
   `GUARDRAILS_LLM_API_KEY` is configured, so every jailbreak/topical check
   500s. The runbook's Phase 2 fixes this (point the engine at RAYIN's own
   LiteLLM gateway instead of a bare provider) — do that before Phase 5, not
   instead of it.
2. **The PII short-circuit will confuse a naive test design.** `rayin-guardrails`
   checks PII *before* the rail flows and returns immediately on a match
   (`app/main.py`). Default PII entities include `PERSON`, so ordinary
   jailbreak payloads carrying a persona name ("Pretend you are DAN", "My
   name is John and...") return `redact` without ever invoking the rail under
   test. `config/guardrails-redteam.yaml`'s grader treats `redact` as
   **inconclusive**, not pass/fail — see the `javascript` assertion in that
   file.
3. **🔴 BFSI data-governance gate.** promptfoo's red-team mode phones home to
   `api.promptfoo.app` by default, sending target URLs, auth headers, prompts
   and responses. `PROMPTFOO_DISABLE_REMOTE_GENERATION=true` is **mandatory**
   for any run against RAYIN — see [Environment variables](#environment-variables)
   below. This does weaken the attacks (promptfoo's own docs: local
   generation is "generally low quality") — a clean result under local-only
   generation is a first-pass fail-open check, not proof of a robust rail.
   Genuinely strong adversarial coverage under BFSI constraints is a
   commercial conversation (promptfoo Enterprise On-Prem), not a config flag.

## Where this runs

**Local/CI first. No in-cluster CronJob yet** (deferred to the runbook's
Phase 8, until a red-team run produces a stable, non-trivial baseline — i.e.
after the rails actually block something). Both targets (`rayin-guardrails`,
LiteLLM) are `ClusterIP`-only, so every run below needs `kubectl
port-forward` first.

## Environment variables

Every invocation of `promptfoo eval` / `promptfoo redteam run` against RAYIN
needs:

```bash
export PROMPTFOO_DISABLE_REMOTE_GENERATION=true   # mandatory — see blocker #3 above
export PROMPTFOO_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1

export LITELLM_PROMPTFOO_KEY="<a dedicated LiteLLM virtual key, see below>"

export LANGFUSE_HOST="https://langfuse-dev.aiatacme.com"
export LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY="pk-lf-..."
export LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY="sk-lf-..."

# For the Langfuse trace export (Phase 6a) — note the two distinct
# PROMPTFOO_OTEL_* vars, not OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT (promptfoo overloads
# that name across both its inbound receiver and outbound SDK).
export PROMPTFOO_OTEL_ENABLED=true
export PROMPTFOO_OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=promptfoo-rayin-<suite-name>   # distinct per suite
export PROMPTFOO_OTEL_ENDPOINT="https://langfuse-dev.aiatacme.com/api/public/otel/v1/traces"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Basic <base64 of pk:sk>,x-langfuse-ingestion-version=4"
export PROMPTFOO_OTEL_DEBUG=true   # export failures are otherwise silent
```

Never set `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` or use `curl -k` against this
environment — the cluster has a real Let's Encrypt certificate (cert-manager),
not a self-signed one. That was true of an earlier (August) environment this
integration was originally scoped against; it is not true today.

## Running the two suites

### Gateway eval (`config/gateway-eval.yaml`) — works today

Tests quality/faithfulness/injection-resistance against RAYIN's LiteLLM
gateway directly. Independent of the guardrails blocker above.

```bash
cd integrations/promptfoo
npm install -g promptfoo@0.123.0
kubectl port-forward -n rayin-platform svc/litellm 4000:4000 &
promptfoo eval -c config/gateway-eval.yaml
promptfoo view
```

Verify traffic actually traversed the gateway (not a direct provider call):

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:4000/key/info -H "Authorization: Bearer $LITELLM_PROMPTFOO_KEY" | jq .info.spend
```

### Guardrails red-team (`config/guardrails-redteam.yaml`) — needs Phase 2 first

Red-teams `rayin-guardrails`' jailbreak rail. Deterministic grading — the
oracle is structural (`action == "block"`), no LLM judge needed for the pass/
fail verdict itself.

```bash
export GUARDRAILS_CONFIG_SECRET="<the rayin-guardrails-config shared secret>"
kubectl port-forward -n rayin-platform svc/rayin-guardrails 8080:8080 &
kubectl port-forward -n rayin-platform svc/litellm 4000:4000 &
promptfoo redteam run -c config/guardrails-redteam.yaml
```

**Read the result with judgment, not just the pass rate:**
- Mostly `INCONCLUSIVE` → the PII short-circuit is dominating. See blocker #2.
- Mostly fail-open → **this is the expected, correct finding**, not a broken
  test. `guardrails_engine.py` detects a fired rail by exact string equality
  against a hardcoded refusal message — any paraphrase, encoding, or wording
  change falls through to `allow`. Log it as real evidence; do not soften the
  assertion to make the suite green.
- `base64`/`rot13` strategies failing while plain-text jailbreak passes
  confirms detection keys on output *wording*, not intent.

## Credentials this integration needs

Two LiteLLM virtual keys and one Langfuse API key pair, all provisioned
against the live cluster — never committed to this repo:

1. **`rayin-guardrails` virtual key** — used to unblock the rail-flow engine
   itself (points `GUARDRAILS_LLM_BASE_URL` at LiteLLM instead of a bare
   provider). May already exist as a starter key from the LiteLLM deploy —
   check `/key/list` before minting a new one.
2. **`promptfoo-eval` virtual key** — dedicated to promptfoo's own traffic, so
   eval/red-team spend is attributable and revocable independently of the
   other two starter keys (`chat-widget`, `rayin-guardrails`). Red-teaming is
   token-hungry; start with `numTests: 3` and few plugins (already set in
   `config/guardrails-redteam.yaml`) rather than a broad run against a $50/
   month cap.
3. **A dedicated Langfuse API key pair** — separate from whatever pair is used
   for other ingestion, so promptfoo's traffic can be revoked independently.

## Status log

**2026-09-12 — scaffolded.** Directory structure, both eval configs, and the
Langfuse-scores hook created on `feat/promptfoo-evals` (based off
`feat/litellm-gateway-chat-integration`, since this depends on LiteLLM being
live). Not yet run against the cluster — Phase 2 (clearing the rail-flow
credential blocker) has not yet been executed, and no eval or red-team run has
produced a real result yet. Next: Phase 2 (unblock rayin-guardrails), then
Phase 4 (gateway eval, works regardless of Phase 2's outcome), then Phase 5
(the red-team run — the actual point of this integration).
